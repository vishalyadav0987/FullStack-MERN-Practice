Great! Since you've chosen **Full Stack** (i.e. **Frontend + Backend**), here's a list of **only Full Stack development-related questions** (no pure DSA/OOP). These questions involve real-world scenarios where **React (frontend)** talks to **Node.js/Express (backend)** and possibly uses **MongoDB**.

ðŸ•’ All can be attempted within a 3-hour assessment (2 medium or 1 large + 1 small)

### ðŸŽ¯ 31â€“40: Auth & User Management (Essential for Full Stack)

31. Signup/login using bcrypt and JWT (Node.js).

### ðŸ“‚ 41â€“45: Project Structure & Clean Code

41. Folder structure of a clean MERN app (split backend & frontend).
42. Create `.gitignore` with node\_modules, .env, dist, etc.
43. Use `dotenv` to manage API keys/secrets.
44. Create and use React Context for global auth state.
45. Use custom error handler middleware in Express.

---

### ðŸš€ 46â€“50: Bonus (Deployment / Extras / Testing)

46. Add environment switching (dev vs prod) in frontend/backend.
47. Use `axios` interceptor for adding auth token to requests.
48. Create loading & error state UI in React during API calls.
49. Host backend on Render and frontend on Vercel/Netlify.
50. Connect to MongoDB Atlas securely using Mongoose.

---

ðŸ“Œ These are **realistic**, **testable**, and **interview-worthy** questions strictly focused on **Full Stack (React + Express + MongoDB)**.
You can expect **2 of these** in your test (e.g., one CRUD + one Auth/API integration problem).

Want me to pick any 2 now and give you a full problem statement like your assessment?
